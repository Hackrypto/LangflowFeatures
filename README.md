# Langflow Tool Calling Agent Test: Math Flow  

This repository demonstrates a test of Langflow's *Tool Calling Agent*, showcasing how different tools can be seamlessly integrated into AI workflows to enhance their capabilities.  

The primary objective of this project is to build a loan calculator that answers user queries based on their profile information while integrating Langflow components like the calculator and OpenAI GPT-4o.

## Project Highlights  

1. **Tool Calling Agent Integration:**  
   - Demonstrates how to use the *Tool Calling Agent* as a wrapper to integrate multiple tools.  

2. **Calculator as a Tool:**  
   - Solves basic arithmetic and loan-related queries, enhancing the accuracy of responses.  

3. **User Profiles:**  
   - Tailors outputs based on user-specific inputs like age, risk appetite, yearly salary, and monthly expenses.  

4. **OpenAI Component:**  
   - Connects to GPT-4o using an OpenAI API key to process questions and provide context-aware outputs.

## How to Use  

### 1. Setup Langflow  
- Install Langflow from its official documentation: [Langflow GitHub](https://github.com/langflow/langflow).  
- Ensure you have access to the OpenAI API key for the LLM component.  

### 2. Import the Flow  
- Open Langflow and log in.  
- Import the `Math_Flow.json` file to load the pre-built flow.  

### 3. Customize Inputs  
- Use the sample inputs from `Math_with_LLM.docs` to test different scenarios.  
- Modify the user profile or question inputs as needed.  

### 4. Run and Observe  
- Execute the flow in Langflow's playground to see how the agent works.  
- Check how outputs change based on different profiles and questions.
